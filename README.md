## Beginnings of Covid-19 in the Netherlands
In the beginning of the pandemic the RIVM only published daily positive cases per municipaltiy. I was wondering how the trend looked like, so started scraping the data. [A blog post](https://jvanelteren.github.io/blog/2020/03/23/analyse.html) is available here. At a certain moment, the RIVM changed reporting the hospitalisations, which was a better metric (mortality even better), so I stopped with this initiative. The scraped hospitalisations are available untill October 2020 though!

### Usage
* 2020-03-23-analyse contains the visualisation
* scraper.py was run daily to gather the csv file
